API Gateway (Node.js/Express): Single entry point for all frontend requests, routing to backend services.
‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup & Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.
Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or higher) & npm (v8 or higher)
Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine for Linux) - Ensure it's running.
MongoDB Community Server (Optional, if not using the Dockerized MongoDB provided by Docker Compose)
1. Clone the Repository
git clone <repository_url>
cd Movie_Ticket_Booking # Navigate to the root of the cloned project


2. Configure Environment Variables
Create .env files in the respective directories:
Project Root (./.env):
This file is for common environment variables used by Docker Compose.
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_make_it_long_and_random

(Replace with a strong, random string. You can generate one online.)
Backend (./backend/.env):
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/movie_booking_db # 'mongodb' is the service name in docker-compose
PORT=5000 # Internal port for backend service
JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET} # References the variable from the project root .env


Gateway (./gateway/.env):
BACKEND_API_URL=http://grabseat-backend:5000 # 'grabseat-backend' is the service name in docker-compose
GATEWAY_PORT=3000 # Internal port for gateway service


Frontend (./frontend/src/environments/environment.ts):
This file is already part of your Angular project. Ensure apiUrl points to your Gateway.
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/api' // Frontend talks to the Gateway
};


3. Build and Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)
This is the easiest way to get all services (MongoDB, Backend, Gateway, Frontend) running.
Navigate to the project root directory:
cd Movie_Ticket_Booking


Build and start all services:
docker compose up --build -d


--build: Builds the Docker images for frontend, backend, and gateway.
-d: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).
Monitor logs (optional but recommended for debugging):
docker compose logs -f

Look for messages indicating successful startup: "MongoDB Connected Successfully...", "Server running on port...", "API Gateway running...", "nginx started".
Check running containers:
docker compose ps

All services should show State: Up.
4. Access the Application
Once all services are running, open your web browser and navigate to:
http://localhost


Your Angular frontend should load. All API requests will automatically be routed through the API Gateway to your backend and MongoDB.
5. Stop the Application
To stop and remove all running containers, networks, and volumes created by Docker Compose:
docker compose down


To also remove the persistent MongoDB data volume (for a clean slate):
docker compose down -v


üìä Database Seeding (Optional)
Your backend includes a script to populate the database with sample data. This is useful for development and testing.
Ensure MongoDB and your Backend container are running (docker compose up -d).
Execute the migration script:
docker compose exec grabseat-backend node src/scripts/migrate-data.js

This command runs the migrate-data.js script inside your grabseat-backend container. You should see console logs indicating data migration progress.
‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment (Cloud Run)
This project is designed to be easily deployable to Google Cloud Run. Each backend service (Backend API, API Gateway) can be deployed as a separate Cloud Run service. The frontend can be served via Cloud Storage/Firebase Hosting or its own Cloud Run service.
General Steps for Cloud Run Deployment (Backend Example):
Prepare Service: Ensure your backend's Dockerfile is ready and its MONGO_URI points to an external MongoDB (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
Build & Push Image: Use gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]/[SERVICE_NAME]:latest .
Deploy to Cloud Run: Use gcloud run deploy [SERVICE_NAME] --image gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]/[SERVICE_NAME]:latest --platform managed --region [REGION] --allow-unauthenticated --set-env-vars ...
Update Frontend apiUrl: Change frontend/src/environments/environment.prod.ts to point to your deployed Cloud Run service URLs.
