            <p class="text-gray-700">
              The dashboard is your central hub for monitoring key business metrics. It provides a real-time, read-only view of key performance indicators (KPIs) like total active movies, today's bookings, and total revenue. It also features charts that help you track trends over time. As an admin, you have access to sensitive data for a complete overview of the platform's performance.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              This section allows you to manage the movie catalog. You can perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This includes adding a new movie with details like title, poster, and synopsis. When a movie is deleted, the system automatically handles cascading deletions of associated shows and seating layouts to maintain data integrity.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              The shows management component is used to manage showtimes and their associated seats. You can create new shows by specifying a movie, a screen, and a date/time. The system automatically generates a seating layout for the new show based on a default template. Deleting a show also removes its associated seating data.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              This is a real-time tool for managing a show's seat layout. You can manually block or unblock seats (e.g., for maintenance or VIP reservations). The system logs every action you take in the database for auditing purposes. This feature is crucial for managing unexpected seating issues.

              This component provides detailed analytics on bookings, revenue, and user data. You can view booking and revenue trends over custom date ranges, and see breakdowns of data by popular movies, screen utilization, and payment methods.
